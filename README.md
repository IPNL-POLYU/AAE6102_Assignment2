## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1 – Differential GNSS Positioning
Write a short essay (500–1000 words) comparing the following GNSS techniques:
- **Differential GNSS (DGNSS)**
- **Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)**
- **Precise Point Positioning (PPP)**
- **PPP-RTK**

### Task 2 – GNSS in Urban Areas
GNSS positioning in urban environments faces challenges due to signal blockage, multipath effects, and limited satellite visibility. For this task, you are provided with:
1. A **skymask** indicating the elevation angle that represents potential satellite visibility blockage for each corresponding azimuth angle.
2. **GNSS raw data**, including pseudorange and carrier phase measurements.

Your objective is to improve GNSS positioning performance using the provided data. You may apply any suitable methods, techniques, or algorithms to enhance accuracy.

### Task 3 – RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring)
RAIM is a critical technique for detecting and excluding faulty GNSS measurements. In this task, you are required to:
- Develop a **weighted RAIM algorithm** to improve positioning performance.
- Based on your **weighted least squares (WLS) code from Assignment 1**, implement a weighted RAIM algorithm to process the provided GNSS data.
- Ensure your solution effectively detects and mitigates the impact of faulty or low-quality measurements.

### Task 4 – LEO Satellites for Navigation
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are widely used for communication but present unique challenges when utilized for navigation. Write a short essay (500–1000 words) discussing:
- The difficulties and challenges of using **LEO communication satellites** for GNSS navigation.

### Task 5 – GNSS Remote Sensing
GNSS is not only used for positioning and navigation but also has significant applications in remote sensing. Write a short essay (500–1000 words) discussing:
- How **GNSS can be used for remote sensing**.
- The principles, techniques, and applications of **GNSS remote sensing**.
